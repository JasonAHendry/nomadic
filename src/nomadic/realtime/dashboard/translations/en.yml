  n_primary: Primary
  n_secondary: Secondary
  n_supplementary: Supplementary
  n_unmapped: Unmapped
  n_primary_tooltip: Number of primary alignments. Primary alignment is the best or main alignment of a read to the reference genome.
  n_secondary_tooltip: Secondary alignments are alternative alignments of a read to the reference genome, which are not the primary alignment. It means that the read could be aligned to multiple locations in the genome.
  n_supplementary_tooltip: Supplementary alignments exist for chimeric reads that have multiple segments aligned to different locations of the reference genome, so the read had to be split into multiple parts.
  n_unmapped_tooltip: Unmapped reads are those that could not be mapped to the reference genome.

  # Regions
  n_reads: Number of reads
  mean_cov: Mean coverage
  cov_gr100_per: Coverage >100x (bp, %%)
  n_reads_tooltip: The number of reads that have been mapped to the region.
  mean_cov_tooltip: The mean coverage over the region.
  cov_gr100_per_tooltip: The percentage of the region that has a coverage greater than 100x.

  # Variant Calls
  variant_heatmap_description: "* The within-sample alternative allele frequency (WSAF) is the fraction of sequencing reads that carry the alternative allele (i.e. variant or mutation). It ranges from 0 to 1."
