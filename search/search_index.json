The colours in the stacked bar indicate the type of alignment that was generated for each read:</p> <ul> <li>Reads with only one unique alignment to the reference genome are shown in dark blue. These are called primary alignments, and are labeled <code>Primary</code>. These are the best for downstream analysis.</li> <li>Reads with no alignments to the reference genome are shown in grey.

This can happen if the read is too short or low quality to be accurately mapped, or derives from an organism other than the reference genome.
